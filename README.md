# TLM Website Redesign

<!-- Description of Technologies Used -->

1. Affinity Designer: Affinity Designer is a graphic design tool program. It is comparable to Photoshop, Sketch and other amazing tools, and will allow you to create a large number of different designs.

I made my TLM logo using Affinity Designer. I chose to make a completely original design, using most of the brand colors that were included in the TLM Brand Guide. I really like the long, winding road, rather than a basic street. I feel it adds a layer of depth to the logo and represents the determination needed to reach success. A long, winding road shows not only what's ahead, but allows you to see where you've been, and the distance you've traveled.



1. HTML: (HyperText Markup Language) is a descriptive language that specifies webpage structure.

For my HTML, I structured each page to fufill what both "Charles" from the Project Prompt, and the Project Requirements were asking for. I tried to make use of the most semantic elements, organized everything to look clean and neat, and utilized comments when it made sense to do so. I even gave a little "walkthrough" with comments in the index.html for more details.



2. CSS: (Cascading Style Sheets) is a declarative language that controls how webpages look in the browser. The browser applies CSS style declarations to selected elements to display them properly. A style declaration contains the properties and their values, which determine how a webpage looks.

For my CSS, I tried to fit as much as I could in one styles.css file, but felt it necessary to make a seperate file to fit my CSS for the contact page, as it was the second largest section requiring CSS. I spaced everything out and used comments to make it well organized and easy for anyone to read. I really only needed 4 media queries between the two CSS files to scale everything up nicely to screen sizes 1024px and 1920px.



3. Bootstrap:  Bootstrap is a free front-end framework for faster and easier web development. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels and many other elements. Bootstrap gives you the ability to easily create responsive designsLinks to an external site.

I made sure to utilize at least 5 Bootstrap features. I used a Navbar with a Collapse button, multiple Containers, two Carousels, an Accordion, and a few other Buttons.



4. Font Awesome: Font Awesome is a website that provides vector icons and social logos to use in your projects.

I used Font Awesome to include some popular icons in the footer. Linkedin, Instagram, Facebook, and an Email icon that actually functions and links to the contact-us.html page from any page.



<!-- How to Use the Front-End as a Typical User -->

A typical user will be able to use this site to get a feel for what The Last Mile is and what they offer. They will be able to easily navigate the website for basic information, learn what courses are available, see inspiring photos, and contact TLM to join or for more questions.

<!-- Color and Design Choices -->

I made a color palette in my style.css file for easy reference that included all of the brand colors and any other colors that I wanted to use for this project. These are the colors I chose:

:root {
  --gold: #DAA520;
  --blue: #2055d9;
  --black: #23221F;
  --true-black: #000000;
  --white: #ffffff;
  --dark-gold: #B87F1B;
  --warm-white: #F8EED5;
  --gray: #AAA99F;
  --light-gray: #F0F0F0;
}

The blue (#2055d9, which is like an electric blue or royal blue) is actually a complimentary color for the gold brand color. I was excited to find a background picture from LightBox of a glowing blue keyboard that was very close to this same color. So i decided to use it as a background theme for all 5 pages. I feel it adds a layer of texture and ordered energy, and fits well with the vibes of the gold and black.

Other than this blue background, I mainly used TLM brand colors, gold and black. I chose the warm-white in Trebuchet MS for most text, as it was soothing and soft. And I chose white in Arial for h1's to be clear and definitive.

For my fonts, I chose Trebuchet MS for a serif with Times as a backup. And Arial for a sans-serif. For my navbar a chose Monospace. Overall three font-families and three fonts.
